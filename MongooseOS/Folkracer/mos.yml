# Custom configuration entries, settable via "device configuration"
# Below is a custom firmware configuration example.
# Uncomment and modify according to your needs:

#config_schema:
 #- ["ghost32.startmodule_signal_gpio", "i", 27, {title: "Startmodule signal pin"}]
 #- ["my_app.bool_value", "b", false, {title: "Some boolean value"}]
# - ["my_app.string_value", "s", "", {title: "Some string value"}]
# - ["my_app.int_value", "i", 123, {title: "Some integer value"}]

# These settings get compiled into the C structure, and can be accessed
# from the C code this way:
#
# printf("Hello from %s!\n", mgos_sys_config_get_device_id());
#
# Settings are cool: can be modified remotely without full firmware upgrade!
#
# To see all available compiled settings, buid the firmware and open
# build/gen/mgos_config.h file.
#
# Also, in this config_schema section, you can override existing
# settings that has been created by other libraries. For example, debug log
# level is 2 by default. For this firmware we can override it to 3:
#
#config_schema:
  #- ["debug.level", 3]
  #- ["my_app.bool_value", true]
  #- ["ghost32.startmodule_signal_gpio", 27]

config_schema:
  - ["hello.who", "s", "world", {"title": "Who to say hello to"}]
  - ["debug.level", 3]
  - ["i2c.enable", true]
  - ["i2c.debug", false]
  - ["i2c.sda_gpio", 21]
  - ["i2c.scl_gpio", 22]
